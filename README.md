My 2019 A-Level Non-Examined Assessment


Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, this project was never completely finished. Please bare this in mind when exploring the work displayed as some incomplete code and features exist.

Abuzz Training ltd. is an employee training business, based in West Yorkshire, which focuses on improv- ing other business’ employees abilities to deliver great customer service, generate leads, and drive sales. Abuzz and it’s employees rely on Apple, Google and Outlook calendar to manage when projects are due and meetings are scheduled Calendars need to be copied daily to ensure each employee has the same information, no matter what device they’re on. When Abuzz is contacted by a potential client, Andrew, the CEO, will personally discuss their needs and will then begin designing a training plan to suit them. Each plan is bespoke and caters exactly to the needs of the business. Following this, meetings, known as training sessions, will be scheduled with the employees which need training, during business hours, and Andrew or another Abuzz employee will deliver a fun, yet insightful session to aid the em- ployees in bettering what they do. Abuzz has an ever-growing number of high value clients, including some of the largest medical and sales businesses in the country, so it’s imperative that every session is run on time, and is well-prepared for.

By the end of this project, I will have generated ideas and conducted research into my project area to understand the best ways to complete the technical solution stage of the project. Afterward, I will have created a piece of software which achieves the objectives set out in the ‘objectives’ section of this re- port (see contents). I will have documented the design, coding and testing phases of this project, as well as my research, and a final evaluation.


This Project, based on the marking criteria set out by my examination board, recieved a 100%, A* Grade at A-Level
